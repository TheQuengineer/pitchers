## Introduction

Salary and performance of pitchers in Major League Baseball is not linear.
An underpaid pitcher is at risk of leaving a team for a better deal elsewhere, where an overpaid pitcher may be weighing down a team's payroll. Teams want undervalued (underpaid) players and they do not want to overpay players. Pitchers -- all players actually -- who are either overpaid or underpaid need to be identified for trade consideration or contract renegotiation. Teams across the major (and minor) leagues are always looking for these scenarios either to create surplus value or to avoid overpaying for a player.
